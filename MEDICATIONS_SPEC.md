# Screen Specification: Sensitivity Profiles (Medications)
**Screen Name:** Sensitivity Profiles – Observational Tracking  
**Primary Goal:** To document the use of medications and supplements and observe potential interactions or sensitivities within the user's hormonal state.

## 1. Screen Purpose
To serve as a "Sensitivity Journal." It allows users to map when they started a new medication and track subjective changes in their energy, mood, or physical state. This creates a data-backed record for informed discussions with prescribing doctors about potential side effects or cycle-specific sensitivities.
