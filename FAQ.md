# Luna Balance: System FAQ

This document provides clarity on the purpose, logic, and boundaries of the Luna Balance system. It is written for non-medical users to ensure safe and constructive engagement with physiological data.

## 1. System Identity & Purpose

### What is Luna Balance?
Luna Balance is a digital map of your physiological patterns. It uses your daily observations and historical markers to show how different hormones—like estrogen, cortisol, and insulin—interact to influence your energy, mood, and behavior. It is an educational tool designed for self-awareness, not medical intervention.

### Is this a period tracker?
While Luna Balance tracks your cycle day to provide context, its primary goal is to map the entire hormonal system. It looks at how stress, metabolism, and reproductive rhythms work together, rather than just predicting your next period.

### Is Luna Balance a medical device?
No. This system does not diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any medical condition. It does not provide medical advice. It is a data-visualization tool intended to help you understand your body’s natural rhythms.

## 2. Understanding the Data

### How can the system know my hormone levels without a blood test?
The system uses a "deterministic mapping" model. Research shows that specific subjective experiences (like cold sensitivity, "wired" energy at night, or afternoon slumps) often correlate with specific physiological states. By logging these sensations, the system maps your probable hormonal status based on established biological patterns.

### What does "Strained" or "Unstable" mean?
These are observational markers, not clinical judgments.
*   **Strained:** Suggests that a specific system is under high demand (e.g., your stress response is working overtime).
*   **Unstable:** Indicates that a marker is fluctuating more than the system expects for your current cycle day.
*   **Balanced:** Suggests the marker is operating within its typical functional baseline.

### Why do some hormones move together?
Hormones are a connected network. For example, sustained high stress (cortisol) can naturally slow down your metabolism (thyroid). Luna Balance visualizes these "Connections" so you can see why one shift in your life might trigger changes elsewhere in your body.

## 3. Medical Boundaries

### Can this tell me if I have PCOS, Thyroid disease, or Perimenopause?
No. Luna Balance can identify *patterns* that are often associated with these states, but it cannot confirm a condition. Only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a diagnosis through clinical examination and testing.

### Should I change my diet or supplements based on the insights?
You should never change your medication, dosage, or significant dietary habits based on this system. The insights are meant to prompt a conversation with your doctor, who can then advise you on the appropriate steps.

### What if the system's "Map" feels wrong?
Subjective mapping relies on consistent data. If your map feels inaccurate, ensure your cycle day is calibrated and you have logged your check-ins for at least 3–5 consecutive days. If it still feels incorrect, trust your own experience over the software and consult a professional.

## 4. Privacy & Data

### Where is my health data stored?
Luna Balance uses "Local Storage." This means your data remains on your physical device (your phone or computer). It is not uploaded to a central cloud server, and the developers cannot see or sell your health information.

### What happens if I clear my browser cache?
Since the data is stored locally, clearing your browser's data or cache will delete your history. We recommend using the "Export Data" feature in the **Dr. Prep** tab regularly to keep a backup file for your own records.

## 5. Working with Doctors

### How should I show this to my doctor?
The **Dr. Prep** tab generates a "Clinical Briefing." This is a plain-text summary of your recent observations. You can show this to your provider or copy it into your patient portal. It is designed to help your doctor see trends that you might forget to mention during a short appointment.

### My doctor doesn't recognize this system. What should I do?
Simply explain that it is a "Symptom and Pattern Log" that you use to track how your energy and mood shift across your cycle. The goal is to provide your doctor with more accurate "real-life" data to assist their clinical assessment.

## 6. Technical & Safety

### Does the AI give me advice?
The AI (Gemini) is used only to synthesize and explain the data you have already provided. It is programmed to use observational language. It is not allowed to give recommendations or prescriptions.

### What if I am in a health crisis?
Luna Balance is not an emergency tool. If you are experiencing severe physical or mental distress, please contact emergency services or a qualified medical professional immediately.
