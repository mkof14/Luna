# Luna Balance: Complete System FAQ

This document provides answers to common questions about the Luna Balance system. Its purpose is to help you navigate your physiological data with clarity and grounded expectations. This guide focuses on real-life usage, system boundaries, and how to effectively use these observations as a support tool for your personal well-being.

## 1. General Understanding of the System

**Q: What is Luna Balance?**
A: Luna Balance is a visual mapping system for your body's physiological rhythms. It looks at how different hormones like estrogen, cortisol, and thyroid markers interact to affect your energy and mood. Instead of just tracking numbers, it creates a "weather map" of your internal state.

**Q: Who is this system for?**
A: This system is designed for any woman who wants to understand her body more clearly. It is helpful for those who want to see the patterns behind their energy shifts and mood changes at any stage of their reproductive life.

**Q: How is this different from typical health or period apps?**
A: Most apps focus solely on predicting your next period. Luna Balance looks at your entire system, including stress hormones and metabolism. It treats your body as a connected network rather than a series of isolated events.

**Q: Do I need medical knowledge to use it?**
A: No. We use plain language and visual indicators like color and magnitude scales to explain what is happening. Any technical terms used are accompanied by a simple explanation.

## 2. What This System Is and Is Not

**Q: Is this a medical product?**
A: No. Luna Balance is a digital educational system, not a medical product, diagnostic tool, or healthcare service. It does not possess clinical certification and is intended for self-awareness only.

**Q: Does it replace a doctor?**
A: No. This system is a preparation tool to use *before* you see your doctor. It organizes your daily observations into a clear summary to help your provider during a visit. Always consult a qualified professional for medical concerns.

**Q: Does it give diagnoses or medical advice?**
A: No. Luna Balance does not provide diagnoses or recommend medications, supplements, or changes in dosage. It identifies patterns and correlations based on the data you log. All medical decisions must be made with your prescribing physician.

## 3. Hormones and Daily Life

**Q: Why do hormones affect my mood and energy?**
A: Hormones act like the background music to your life. They influence how your brain processes signals and how your cells use fuel, setting the baseline for your daily resilience and energy levels.

**Q: Why is stress so influential on other hormones?**
A: Cortisol is your survival signal. When stress is high, the system prioritizes survival over other functions like digestion or reproductive rhythms, often "shouting over" other hormonal signals.

**Q: What does a 'Strained' state look like in real life?**
A: A "Strained" status means your system is working overtime to keep up with high demand. You might feel this as physical heaviness or being "on edge." It is a prompt to prioritize recovery.

## 4. Cycle and Female Phases

**Q: Why does my cycle affect how I feel?**
A: Your cycle is an internal climate. Different hormones rise and fall to prepare your body for different tasks, shifting your energy, mood, and cognitive focus across four "internal seasons."

**Q: What if my cycle is irregular?**
A: The system is flexible. You can use the "Temporal Scrubber" to align the map with your actual physical signs rather than being forced into a standard 28-day box.

**Q: Can the system help if I'm on hormonal birth control?**
A: Yes, but your map will look different. Birth control typically creates a steady baseline rather than a natural wave. You can still track how you feel daily to identify sensitivities or responses to that steady state.

## 5. Emotions, Mood, and Relationships

**Q: Is this “just hormones”?**
A: Your feelings are valid responses to life. Hormones don't create "fake" emotions, but they can lower your threshold for things that bother you, effectively turning up the "volume" on your emotional responses.

**Q: Why do I react differently to people at different times?**
A: Your social capacity is influenced by your physiological state. In high-energy phases, you may feel more outgoing. In restorative phases, your need for predictability increases, making social friction feel more grating.

**Q: How should partners or family understand this?**
A: Partners can view the "Rhythm Map" as a weather report for the household. It helps them know when to offer more support or give you the space your body is naturally asking for.

## 6. Lab Results and Medical Tests

**Q: Why do lab results feel so confusing?**
A: Reports use clinical language and wide "normal" ranges that don't always account for your cycle phase. Luna Balance focuses on the *function* of the marker to make the data feel relevant to your daily life.

**Q: Does the system interpret my labs?**
A: The system *decodes* labs into plain language based on physiological principles. It explains what a marker does (e.g., managing metabolic speed) but does not provide a clinical opinion or diagnosis.

**Q: Can my labs look "normal" even if I feel unwell?**
A: Yes. Clinical ranges are designed to find disease, not define "optimal" well-being. Luna Balance helps you map these "sub-clinical" patterns so you can better describe your experience to a doctor.

## 7. Medications and Side Effects

**Q: Why do side effects feel so unpredictable?**
A: Side effects are often interactions between a substance and your current physiological state. Since your state shifts throughout the month, your sensitivity to a medication may also shift.

**Q: What is a "Sensitivity Profile"?**
A: It is a dedicated space to track a single medication or supplement. It allows you to see if your subjective experiences correlate with that substance over time or within specific cycle phases.

**Q: Does the system provide safety warnings?**
A: No. It does not provide clinical alerts or automated interaction checks. It is a space for you to organize your own observations to share with a professional.

## 8. Using the System Day to Day

**Q: How often should I perform a check-in?**
A: One "Daily Sync" every morning or evening is ideal. It takes less than 60 seconds and builds a reliable map of your baseline energy and mood.

**Q: What if I skip several days?**
A: Don't worry—just resume as soon as you can. The system handles occasional gaps, though checking in 4–5 times a week provides the most accurate "Temporal Record."

**Q: Is it useful if I feel perfectly fine?**
A: Yes. Tracking when you feel "fine" establishes your personal "Balanced" baseline. This makes it much easier to identify when something shifts later on.

## 9. Working with Doctors

**Q: How does this help doctor visits?**
A: It removes "recall bias." Instead of guessing how you felt weeks ago, you can provide a synthesized history. It moves the conversation from vague feelings to specific patterns.

**Q: Will doctors accept data from an app?**
A: Most doctors value "patient-reported outcomes." presentando your data as a structured log provides higher-quality information to assist their clinical decision-making.

**Q: How should I share my summaries?**
A: Use the "Dr. Prep" tab to generate a "Clinical Briefing." It is a concise, scan-ready summary designed for a busy professional to read in under 60 seconds.

## 10. Limitations and Expectations

**Q: What exactly can this system NOT do?**
A: It cannot detect diseases, prescribe medications, or replace physical exams. It cannot "fix" your hormones; it only maps your current state so you can make informed choices.

**Q: Why doesn't it make predictions?**
A: Biology is influenced by thousands of shifting variables (stress, sleep, genetics). Attempting to "forecast" medical outcomes is clinically unsound. We focus on where you are *now* and your historical trends.

**Q: What does "success" actually look like?**
A: Success is self-awareness. It is the transition from confusion and self-blame ("Why am I like this?") to clarity and informed action ("I see this is a physiological shift, not a personal failing").

## 11. Common Misunderstandings

**Q: Is this saying everything is because of hormones?**
A: No. Hormones are the "internal weather," but your life and environment are the "landscape." Luna Balance maps the weather so you can navigate the landscape better.

**Q: Is this making excuses for behavior?**
A: No. Understanding a biological root is about self-awareness, not avoiding responsibility. It helps you manage your reactions more effectively by knowing your current capacity for friction.

**Q: Is this only for people with "hormone problems"?**
A: No. Mapping your state when you feel "balanced" is just as important as mapping it when you feel "strained." Self-awareness is a tool for everyone.
